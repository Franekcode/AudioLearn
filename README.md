# AudioLearn
AudioLearn is a tool designed to enhance learning and information consumption in challenging environments. It converts articles, blogs, and textbook excerpts into audio format (like podcasts or audiobooks), making learning possible during driving, commutes, exercise, or any situation where reading and leaning over your phone is impractical.
